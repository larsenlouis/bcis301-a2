\section{Data Analysis}

\subsection{Overview of Data}
% In our selection of literature, 6 articles are employed. \citetitle{1} and \citetitle{2} are on project management. \citetitle{3} argues about change management while \citetitle{4} and \citetitle{5} are on risk management. \citetitle{6} gives an overview and an update of information system success and failure, which is composed by an affiliation of famous scholars in the field.
Besides the interview scripts notes which was taken by Sarah last year, we also interviewed Sarah and Mehdi two weeks ago. Though Dabid is also planned to be interviewed by us, finally we didn't get a chance to interview him for unknown reasons. So those scripts and both interview to Sarah and Mehdi comprised our information resources. Based on this information, we conducted a qualitative analysis and got thirty-two facts across twelve functions.

\subsection{Primary Themes}
Five primary themes of the issues were finally identified from thirty-one secondary themes in our coding data, which were budget, communication, manual process, security, and software. 

\subsubsection{Budget} is about the expenditure for a department in annual reckoning. It is usually fixed but deficient since unexpected expense happened casually. Insufficient budget was noticed through the research at the first phase . The interviewee from CISCO Network Academy informed us that they need more expensive switches and routers to extend the network being used. They need more space to accommodate student and equipments. They also want to attract more students to learn networking, and they need more money to carry out marketing activities. They actually met difficulties in convincing Ara that paying more money to Cisco Network Academy is worthy enough. Budget issue is a realistic problem, while it is mainly a governance problem. Mostly, we cannot resolve it by technical means.

\subsubsection{Communication} has been recognized as a general issue for CISCO Network Academy and the Operations Manager. According the interview to the tutor of CISCO Network Academy, the desire to maintain a better connection with previous students was expressed. He also pointed out that nothing was taught on teaching students how to create connections with industry except the "geeky stuff" in their Academy. For our students, it is important to own soft power besides their technical power to get competitive power in the talents market. How to create a safe and effective social community? It is one of the important issue to be resolved. The Operation Manager claimed that "no one know we are the biggest CISCO system trainer in New Zealand". In Regards to the roles and responsibilities, there is a serious issue of lack of awareness and communication. Besides this complain, the engagment with student was also defective, it needs to be improved by better communication tool and mechanics.

\subsubsection{Manual process} is one of the most complained issue in this analysis. It was reported by almost all the interviewee, that is Mehdi, Sarah, the tutor from Ethics, the tutor from Tech Labs, the tutor from software engineering, the OP Manager. All of them have met some inconvenience from manual process in their daily work. Below are the details of these inconvenience.

\paragraph{Timetabling} The interviewee which is the OP manager claimed that there is no specific IT program for timetabling, she has to talk with individual tutors and manually find out which teaching sessions or hours are required, and manually put this information into a spreadsheet. Even more distressing is that this is not the end. Once she complete the task on the spreadsheet,she has to manually put the timetable data into tribal software. She is tired with these things, it is not only boring, inefficient, but also error-prone. 

\paragraph{CAPEX Requests} Similar scene occurs on processing CAPEX requests. The same OP Manager is also in charge of processing CAPEX requests for computing team. Mannually filling in forms is required. Manually tracking the status of each CAPEX requests is an impossible task. Thus, there is no way to guarantee if the money has been correctly spent. 

\paragraph{Result System} In regards to the results of the students, once a tutor confirmed the result for certain student, he or she could immediately get his or her result. It is good. However, in case the tutor makes a mistake with certain result, the tutor has to perform a manual process to change the result.  

Ethics	"Applications:
Have to fill out a form with aim and objectives"
Ethics	"Electronic versions of the completed form are sent to the committee

- Results Meeting:
     Used to identify students that may need additional Support
     Check consistency of grading
     Not a formal cross-checking process
     Preparation for the results meeting:
       No auto extraction from the Tribal Database
       Results are manually populated into a spreadsheet
       This spreadsheet is then discussed at the results meeting
       Occurs at the end of every semester prior to results being confirmed as final"
OP Manager	"Re-Enrolment – System generated form that is required to be printed and signed by staff/students
- All manual with forms – no System
   Would like for it to be more automated"
OP Manager	"Change management processes within the department have not been going well due to lack of resources
  - Groups of lecturers from every group get together to formally discuss and evaluate new curses
      Forms need to be filled out
      All paper based/MS word
      No application used to simplify the process
  - Institution doesn’t require lecturers to re-evaluate courses, but most do anyway
      Not a formal process
      Each program has a MOE required review
      Not at a course level, but at a program level (IE degree)
  - Academic services assist with the documentation side of things
      Not assisted by an IT system"
OP Manager	"Moderation of assessments
  - Decided to have a 5 year strategy
  - Each 5 yrs each course has an external assessment
  - Priority is given to new courses/tutors
  - Completely manual process
  - All in a spreadsheet
  - Someone has to remember to do it
  - Manual follow up if this has been done
  - Would like to try and minimalise reliance on actual people 
      Risk reduction
      Tech could assist"
Software Engineering Tutor	"Important to do a register for each class
  - Either pass a sign in sheet around, or update on tribal
  - Tried to do it all automatically
      Attendance database is run by tribal
      Don’t allow an automatic batch update
  - Tried RFID card scanning
      Project completed and worked well
        Can’t be updated into tribal
  - Originally just got students to write their names on paper
      Too hard to pick out names
  - Looked at facial recognition
      Already have pictures on files from student ID
      Would need permission from students to film the class
      Would still need to manually update TRINBAL
  - Gave up and now uses a printed name list, with students signing by their name
      Easier to recognise names
      Hard as a non-native English speaker to read handwriting"
Tech Labs Tutor	"Stuff is bought through the IT department
- Time consuming
- Lots of paperwork
- Forms hard/not liked
- Rather go out and buy an item then charge it back"
Sarah	Booking a room needs to talk to Sandy 
Sarah	Fill timesheet to get paid.
Mehdi	"-	The internal process is manual
-	Change something in course (eg. network protocol)
-	Form -> Division -> Approval
-	Should be inspected by two people to approve
-	Manual monitoring"

\subsection{Gaps and Solutions}

% 这里加个层级图 ? 就是一堆问题（1层)，一堆解决方案(2层), 选定的解决方案(3层)，
% The gaps and the solutions often express the same meanings but with different wording. Gaps are often stated as "lack of something" while the solutions suggest to supplement the missing part. Therefore, we only collect the proposals that the literature suggests, for the sake of conciseness.

% We have extracted 32 sections containing 48 proposals contributing to success, failure or risks from the 6 articles. We have also tagged the affected phases and the affected roles for each proposal. The weights of priority are also recorded and normalized in the researches where the authors conclude with a math model. A baseline value of $1$ is given to those proposals from which the authors have not built a math model.

Below are a few typical samples for each themes:

\subsubsection{Samples: Budget}

% On page 9 of \citetitle{3}, \citeauthor{3} argue that the design must be established consistently. Obviously, to prevent unnecessary reconfiguration at each implementation stage, a consistent well-thought-out ERP design that meets the needs of the organization should be established.



% On page 11 of \citetitle{2}, \citeauthor{2} put emphasis on the suggestion that proactively assesses the performance of a vendor and develop a list of performance metrics for vendors. The project manager should set up objective and clear evaluation criteria for the supplier in advance and ensure that the supplier complies with the evaluation criteria during the implementation of the project. In addition, the project manager should regularly evaluate the progress of the project rather than just evaluating it at the end of the project. Only in this way, once the deviation from the standard occurs, the project manager can know what and why the deviation occurs in time, and take appropriate measures to ensure that the deviation is solved in time. After all, it is not enough to rely solely on the vendor to solve problems themselves. In general, periodically assessment is important because it is a reliable method to help the project manager understanding the situation of that time. Additionally, it is also good to maintain a good vendor-client partnership.

\subsubsection{Samples: Communication}
% \citeauthor{2} suggests that keep 85\% of business process common and set up a decision committee on page 11 of \citetitle{2}. Better relationship between project managers and the management is pretty important to IT Projects. To establish and maintain a good relationship between them, on the one hand, project manages should keep the project scope as consistent as possible with the management; on the other hand, in order to reduce or avoid the resistance of end users from different regions, product managers should consider forming a priority committee. It can be an important scope management tool because its members come from different regions, so the scope decision process is largely transparent to them.

% \citeauthor{6} recommend that it is better to identify the problem before proposing a solution and to understand user requirements before designing a system on page 10 of \citetitle{6}. A common mistake is to start designing a solution only with a rough understanding of the problem to be solved, especially for those experienced people. As the saying goes, a good question is better than a great answer. It can be an essential rule that taking more time to understand the problem before making a decision.

\subsubsection{Samples: Manual process}
% In \citetitle{3}, the author argues that it is important to have effective communication at each level. Efficient and effective communication is an integral part of the successful implementation of IT projects. During an IT project life cycle, communication is necessary at every level of the project. According to Mandal and Gunasekaran (2003), opinions from users about their requests, responses, objections or approvals are always important. Project progress should be communicated regularly to management so they can understand the current status of the project. As for the objectives, activities, news or updates, it should be promptly notified to the relevant staff in the project.


% To manage the communication process and create a forum is the suggestion given by \citeauthor{2} when talking about success of building an ERP system. Therefore, the project manager should work hard to manage the communication process, including communicating with management and communicating downwards. Based on this, it is necessary to create a forum where stakeholders can prioritize and discuss issues. There are various conflicts between business and IT projects, and successfully managing these conflicts is essential to the success of IT projects. Guiding end-users to participate in projects can effectively reduce or resolve these conflicts, and those projects that end users actively participate in are often successful.

\subsubsection{Samples: Security}
% \citeauthor{6} believe that getting top management support is important for the successful implementation of IT on page 10 of \citetitle{6}. According to Markus (1983) and Elbanna (2012), getting top management support is still the most important principle for helping project success. It is reasonable since projects usually cannot run smoothly without top management support, especially when the project is under construction.

% For vendor support, \citeauthor{6} also suggest that it is important to obtain “independent” advice from a consultant. As for selecting an appropriate vendor, in order to obtain objective and fair comparison results, independent third-party professional consultants should be sought (Pollock and Williams 2009).

\subsubsection{Samples: Software}


\subsection{Evaluation of Solutions}
% \label{section:evaluation}
% To clarify the result, we collect the data into a spreadsheet in which contains the following criteria: No., proposal, article identifier, coding identifier, affected phases, affected roles.
% % \begin{table}[ht] 
% % \caption{Coding(header only)}
% % \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
% % \csvautotabular{tables/coding_sample.csv}
% % }
% % \label{tab:sample}
% % \end{table}

% With the defined method, we tag our research contexts in the following sequence.
% $C_{1}$ is \citetitle{1}.
% $C_{2}$ is \citetitle{2}.
% $C_{3}$ is \citetitle{3}.
% $C_{4}$ is \citetitle{4}.
% $C_{5}$ is \citetitle{5}.

% According to the defined method, we have everything for the evaluation process. Due to the fact that the studies are not conducted with a math model in $C_{2}$ and $C_{4}$, we assume all the solutions from the aforementioned researches are of equal importance. Therefore, we pad the cross-contextual coefficient with a baseline value of 1 to $\mathit{f_{C_{2,j}}}$ and $\mathit{f_{C_{4,j}}}$.

% Using the formula \ref{final}, we calculate the global influence score for each proposal. Here is a visualization of the scores of all the proposals as in figure \ref{fig:rankingp1}

% \begin{figure}[ht]
% \centering
% \caption{Proposal Ranking in Phase 1}
% \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
% \includegraphics{global_influence_score.png}
% }
% \label{fig:rankingp1}
% \end{figure}

% In Figure \ref{fig:rankingp1}, the horizontal axis stands for all the proposals in context $\mathbb{C}$ and the vertical axis for global influence score. It is clear that there are 4 proposals of significant influence clustering at the top followed by a second group at range roughly between 4 to 6. The trailing group of low influence score occupies the range between 1 to 3.

\subsection{Result of Evaluation}
% For the effectiveness and conciseness, we truncate the trailing group scored lower than average($\bar{g}=3.60$), which is also the trailing group. We obtain the following list of solutions.

% \begin{table}[ht]
% \caption{Solution List Of Phase 1}
% % \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
% \begin{adjustbox}{width=1\textwidth}
% \csvautotabular{tables/solutions.csv}
% \end{adjustbox}
% % }
% \label{tab:solution}
% \end{table}

% % To track their origins of sources, we mark them with the article themes as shown in \ref{tab:solution}. There are 10 solutions about project management, 8 about risk management and 5 about change management.
