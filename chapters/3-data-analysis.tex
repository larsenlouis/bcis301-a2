\section{Data Analysis}

\subsection{Overview of Data}

Besides the interview scripts notes which were taken by Sarah last year, we also interviewed a student/teaching assistant and the head of the department two weeks ago. Though another student/teaching assistant is also planned to be interviewed by us, we have not had a chance to interview him for unknown reasons. So those scripts and both interviews with the student and the head of department are asset we possess. Based on this information, we conducted a functional analysis and qualitative analysis which collect 32 facts across 12 functions.

\subsection{Functional Analysis}

Department of Computing is the department dedicated teaching ICT students, which provides courses of software engineering, networking, business analysis, cyber security. Three divisions, that is administrative support, Operational Manager (ICT as a profession), and Operational Manager (Community Computing) comprise this Department. From the name of these divisions we can see that two main teaching fields which are IT as profession and communication computing are provided in this department.

\subsection{Primary Themes}
Five primary themes of the issues are identified from 21 secondary themes in our coding data, which were budget, communication, manual process, security, and software. Below are a few typical samples for each theme.

\subsubsection{Budget}
Budget is about the expenditure for a department in annual reckoning. It is usually fixed but deficient since unexpected expense happened casually. Insufficient budget was noticed through the research at the first phase. The interviewee from CISCO Network Academy informs us that they need more expensive switches and routers to extend the network being used. They need more space to accommodate student and equipments. They also want to attract more students to learn networking, and they need more money to carry out marketing activities. They actually meets difficulties in convincing Ara that paying more money to Cisco Network Academy is worthwhile enough. Budget issue is a realistic problem, while it is mainly a governance problem. Through deploying more Linux systems can alleviate the budget issues to some extent. Mostly, we cannot do more to resolve them by technical means. Therefore, we will not discuss this issue much in this article.

\subsubsection{Communication}
Communication has been recognized as a general issue for CISCO Network Academy and the Operations Manager. According the interview to the tutor of CISCO Network Academy, the desire to maintain a better connection with previous students was expressed. He also pointed out that nothing was taught on teaching students how to create connections with industry except the "geeky stuff" in their Academy. For our students, it is important to own soft power besides their technical power to get competitive power in the talents market. How to create a safe and effective social community is one of the important issues to be resolved. The Operation Manager claimed that no one knows we are the biggest CISCO system trainer in New Zealand. Regarding to the roles and responsibilities, there is a serious issue of lacking of awareness and communication. Besides this complaint, the engagement with students is also defective, it needs to be improved by better communication tool and mechanics.

\subsubsection{Manual Process}
Manual Process is one of the most complained issues in this analysis. There are so many manual processes involved in almost all functions in the computing department. It is reported by all the interviewees, that is the head of the department, the student/teaching assistant, the tutor from Ethics, the tutor from Tech Labs, the tutor from software engineering, and the OP Manager. All of them have experienced various inconvenience from manual process (mainly paperworks) in their daily work. Below are the details which are cataloged in functions for these inconvenience.

\paragraph{Administration}
The head of the department, as the most important person in the computing department, also feels pain on his administrative things since the internal process is manual. He has pointed out that changing something in course, such as network protocols, he had to fill in forms and send the forms to corresponding division, then wait for approvals. All the processes, including the monitoring process, are manual process, which is lots of paperworks. As spectators, we can feel the pain when we review the interview scripts. Additionally, the tutor from Tech Labs suggests that the purchase management is also paper based. When they need to buy equipment or something else, they have to fill out quite a few paper forms for the IT department to review and purchase.

\paragraph{Timetabling}
The interviewee which is the OP manager claims that there is no specific IT program for timetabling, that she has to talk with individual tutors and manually find out which teaching sessions or hours are required, and that she has to manually put this information into a spreadsheet. Plus, the more distressing is that this is not the end. Once she completes the task on the spreadsheet, she has to manually put the timetable data into tribal software. She is tired with these things, it is not only boring, inefficient, but also error-prone. 

\paragraph{CAPEX Requests}
Similar scene occurs on processing CAPEX requests. The same OP Manager is also in charge of processing CAPEX requests for computing team. Manually filling in forms is required. Tracking the status of each CAPEX requests is an impossible task by human labor. Thus, there is no way to guarantee if the money has been correctly spent.

\paragraph{Attendance}
There is no an unified automatic attendance system in the Computing department. Part of teachers use class time to manually tick every student using the tribal application, which is rather time consuming in a larger class. Other teachers use a paper sheet, which allows students sign on it. Sometimes a teacher or a teaching assistant may forget to pass the paper sheet to students, which eventually all the students being "absent". This situation has been observed and experienced several times by us in this semester. In fact, a conclusion can be made that both approaches are far from ideal. The tutor from the Software Engineering section argues that they have tried many alternatives but none of them is ideal.

\paragraph{Result System}
Regarding to the results of the students, once a tutor confirmed the result for certain student, he or she can immediately get his or her result, which is good. However, in case the tutor makes a mistake with certain result, the tutor has to perform a manual process to change the result. 

\paragraph{Ethics Applications}
The ethics tutor, who charges of managing the ethics in the computing department, claims that a student who needs ethics clearance has to fill out four ethics applications, and that every application is a paperwork. Filling out the paper form is not conducive to keeping the participants anonymous. It is much better if they are filled in an online form remotely instead of a paper form.

\paragraph{Booking Classrom}
Besides the functions we mentioned in earlier paragraph, one of the teaching assistant representatives, she suggests there is no IT system to help them accomplish their assistant work. As a busy student to graduate, she has to filled in paper time sheet to get paid. In addition, booking a classroom is also manual process, which requires her to talk with the Operating Manager to get or to confirm a classroom, according to the interview.

\subsubsection{Security} 
Security is critical for any computer system, especially for those computer system which is used for public  purpose. For security reasons, there are many restricts to the students when they access the computers in a computer lab. Below are some of the issues students and teachers may encounter at a computer Lab.

\paragraph{Separated Networks}
Nowadays, networking technique develops fast day by day. However, for historical and security reasons, we were told that the network in CISO Network Academy is physically separated from the Ara network. The separation of the two networks is important for security. On the other hand, it has brought much inconvenience to teachers and students. For instance, somethings can only do on tech labs network, If a student need to access any content on the Ara network, he has to walk to an Ara computer labs to get those content then come back because the two networks are separated. It is no surperise that someone cannot access S disk or other shared drive on certain computer. People know that this is because security reasons but inconvenience is inconvenience, there should be an approach can reach both the requirements from CISCO Network Academy and Software Engineering. In terms of current status, both networks have security problems. According one of the interviewees from Cisco Network Acddemy, around 50 pages security reports are generated for both tech labs netowrk and Ara network annually, and the issues in the reports needs to be fixed as soon as possible.

\paragraph{Permissions}
Computer labs are the most frequently visited place for the students in the department of Computing. Unfortunately, it is also a place that students may encounter troubles. Considering the security of the operating system, student cannot install new software onto the host operating system of the computer in computer labs. So students can only use the pre-installed software on these computers. We were told and experienced that the number and variety of pre-installed software are different. We often encounter that there is no Visio installed on this computer at this computer Lab, and there is no office on that computer at another computer Lab. The most astounding thing is that Git which is the most popular version control system, is not installed on all machines either. Similarly, an interviewee from Software Engineering division also complained that they have no permission to create virtual machines and cannot do certain things, such as install new version of the development tools.

\subsubsection{Software} 

\paragraph{Network Virtualization}


CISCO Network Academy	"Looking to move away from purchasing hardware, to cloud based networks
  Virtualised devices"	expect to have virtualized environment	Software	Cisco Program delivery
Software Engineering Tutor	"Looking at Docker
- Ike a sandbox environment
- Easily create and destroy programs


- Don’t have access to Docker on the Ara network
- Trying to work with Tech lab to run Docker on their network in the future
"	more freedom to run software	Software	Course delivery

\paragraph{Moodle and Myday}

Tech Labs Tutor	"- Moodle is an imperfect tool
     Terrible text editor – have to use HTML to make it look better
     Labs ect. Can be put into moodle
     Can log in and see what students have ben accessing
     Can identify students dropping the ball
- No notifications are given, have to physically check logs, but can then see what students have been accessing"	disadvantages of Moodle	Software	Administration
Tech Labs Tutor	"Licencing of software not always clear on virtual machines
Sarah	"
-	Moodle
-	Some parts are good - well covered
-	Some parts are not consistent - nothing really there
-	Task due day not working ( 10 years old due day )
-	Myday.ara.ac.nz is not used at all.
-	Directly use Moodle and outlook as alternative"	Disadvantages of Moodle / myday	Software	course delivery

\paragraph{Microsoft and Linux}

- Microsoft licencing in particular complex
     Have to be a lawyer and a genius to understand
     Took a month or two in the states to work out the licencing issue
     Always want to be legal, but need to be sure – Microsoft NZ couldn’t answer the question
     Remote access licences not valid – according to Microsoft
       Have LIBRA office instead
       Possibly looking at changing to LINUX desktops"	legal issues with Microsoft	Software	Course delivery
Mehdi	"-	Computing VS IT
