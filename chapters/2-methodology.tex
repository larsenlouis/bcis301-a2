\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Synopsis}

For the deployment plan, research is conducted to build this plan with the following steps.

First, data is collected by both the transcripts of existing interviews and the transcripts that the authors have compiled with working staffs of the Computing Department.

Next, with all the data prepared, data analysis is done by first investigating the functions inside the organization, also known as thematic analysis, then by a qualitative analysis which identifies the facts and issues. To better find possible solutions in this context, a generic IT deployment strategy is selected among the options.

With the issues identified and the best-fit generic IT deployment strategy, solutions are proposed for each function of the organization. Then, a framework is utilized to select the best solutions among all the proposals.

Finally, a hierarchy of the deployment plan is illustrated by filling the results above into the tree structure, which visually present the deployment plan.


\subsection{Data Collection}	
	% 采访稿
The data consists of two sources. The first source is the existing transcripts of interviews conducted by former students, in which 6 staff members are interviewed, giving responsibilities, reflecting the structural layout of the department and commenting on the existing issues. The transcripts cover the following topics of Cisco network academy, ethics, operation manager, software engineering and TechLabs.
	% 对 Sarah Medhi的采访
The second source is from our interviews of the acting head of the department and a student and teaching assistant. The interviews are held in two sessions and questions are raised about issues and opinions on the department.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
With all the transcripts of interviews compiled, data analysis commences with the following steps. 
	% function analysis (thematic analysis)
Functions are first identified by thematic analysis. The current situation and technologies are investigated in the thematic analysis, which serves as the assets for the next step to be illustrated next. The functional analysis covers the current jobs and duties inside the department and the related IT technologies deployed in the department.
	% qualitative analysis

With all the functions inside the department defined, a qualitative analysis is progressed, trying to find all the issues that can be classified into primary themes after collecting their secondary themes based on facts. In other words, the outcome of qualitative analysis are facts, issues, secondary themes, and primary themes.

	% Generic IT Deployment Strategies (centrally planned)
Generic IT deployment strategies conclude the general rules applied to a variety of organization. There are 7 types of organizations: centrally planned, leading edge, free market, monopoly, scarce resource, and a necessary evil. A type is selected to draft solutions and to select the solutions, according to the features that the Computing Department has.

\subsection{Solution Analysis}
	% 对每一类问题给解决方案
Solutions are given to each primary theme, the generalized topics are identified in the qualitative analysis. Furthermore, the solutions seek to cover one or more topics of issues to some extent. All the potential solutions are the candidates that will be evaluated in a framework to select the best practice to be done.
	% 得分表算法
The Evaluation framework tries to assess the ability to solve the generalized topics of primary themes in qualitative analysis. For each solution, the score calculates as follows.

$$
R_{S_i} = \sum_{j=1}^n{r_{S_i, t_j}}
\label{eq:score}
$$

$R$ denotes a final rating. $S_i$ is a candidate solution. Thus, $r_{S_i}$ is the final rating of a given candidate solution. $t_j$ is the primary theme of a given generalized issue. Therefore, $\sum_{j=1}^n{r_{S_i, t_j}}$ is a rating out of 10 for the ability to solve the specific generalized topic of issues $S_{t_i}$. If the solution brings positive impact of the given topic of issues, a positive score will be rated. On the contrary, a negative score will be marked if there is a negative effect on the same topic of issues. The range of the score $r_{S_i, t_j} \in [-10, 10]$

The average score of $\bar{R_{S}}$ of all the solutions are calculated. Every solution above the average score is considered as approved solution to be selected the deployment plan.


\subsection{Deployment Plan}
	% 对evaluated 的方案放入hierachy
The deployment plan puts all the building blocks into a hierarchy structure to illustrate the whole decision-making process in a visually expressive way, where the goals, issues, solutions, the selected of solutions and the connections between the elements.


% % 总流程
% \subsection{Synopsis}
% The study consists of two phases. For each phase, a qualitative analysis is first carried out, identifying all the gaps and possible solutions(proposals) that the researchers suggest regarding success, failure, and risks in ICT projects. To identify these themes, a list of excerpts(facts) is built and then reworded as proposals. Those proposals are evaluated in a quantitative model which results in a solution list for each phase. The items in both solution lists are compared and contrasted and reshaped into a mark sheet as the evaluation tool we create. Additionally, Tags, such as affected phases and affected roles, are used for the evaluation process; the primary themes in qualitative analysis are top-level categories in the final outcome of the evaluation tool we create. Following paragraphs will give more details about how the tags are utilized throughout the research method.


% % 列举文章和主题
% \subsection{Selection of Literature}
% In Phase 1, we focus on three themes regarding the success of an IT project, namely project management, change management, and risk management. Also, CSF(critical success factor), CFF(critical failure factor), ERP(enterprise resource planning) are the keywords used in the literature selections. All the sources should be from professional journals and forums published within 10 years from now, around 10 pages of length and referenced by other researchers, which reliability and professionalism can be assured.

% In Phase 2, we are given 10 case studies in \citetitle{case_study} which illustrates 10 IT deployment projects in Victoria, Australia. We conduct our research using the same procedure as in Phase 1.

% % 如何 coding
% \subsection{Data Analysis}
% When utilizing the aforementioned selection of literature for qualitative analysis, we seek to identify issues, solutions and/or conclusions that authors have deduced or based on. Excerpts of facts are compiled in this stage. Furthermore, the phases and the roles of stakeholders involved are also noted when a possible clue is identified. Priority information in the same research context is recorded as well, which as known weights. For each of the excerpt, we reword the statement as possible proposals. All possible proposals are also tagged with affected phases and affected roles from their respective excerpt. This asset is now ready for the subsequent evaluation processes.

% % 如何做 evaluation framework
% \subsection{Evaluation Process}
% With this captured data in each phase, an evaluation is designed where all the proposals are listed and evaluated by how a given proposal affects on the phases of a project and on the roles of stakeholders in corresponding phases. To better employ the prioritized proposals by some researchers who use statistical models, a cross-contextual coefficient is introduced during the evaluation process. In the evaluation process, global influence score of a proposal in a specific research context is calculated by the following formula \ref{brief}.
% \begin{equation}
% g_{C_{i},j} = \mathit{k_{C_{i},j}}l_{C_{i},j},\ C_{i,j} \in C_{i},\ C_{i} \in \mathbb{C}
% \label{brief}
% \end{equation}

% In formula \ref{brief}, $\mathbb{C}$ denotes the set of all research contexts. And for each research context $C_{i}$ which is an element in $\mathbb{C}$, $C_{i,j}$ denotes a proposal in the given research context $C_{i}$. $g_{Ci,j}$ is the global influence score of a proposal in a given research context $C_{i}$. Similarly, $l_{C_{i},j}$ is the local influence score of the same proposal; $\mathit{k_{C_{i},j}}$ is the cross-contextual coefficient for the same proposal. Each element on the right hand side of formula \ref{brief} can be calculated respectively as follows.
% \begin{equation}
% \mathit{k_{C_{i},j}} = \frac{f_{C_{i,j}}}{\bar{f_{C_i}}}
% \label{coefficient}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% \bar{f_{C_i}} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{m=1}^n{f_{C_{i,m}}}\right)
% \label{mean}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% l_{C_{i},j} = |P_{C_{i,j}}||R_{C_{i,j}}|
% \label{local_influence}
% \end{equation}

% In formula \ref{coefficient} and \ref{mean}, $f_{C_{i,j}}$ denotes the local influence score in a research context $C_{i}$ and $\bar{f_{C_i}}$ is the arithmetic mean value of all local influence scores of proposals in a given context $C_{i}$.

% In formula \ref{local_influence}, $l_{C_{i},j}$ is the local influence score of a given proposal $C_{i,j}$. $|X|$ denotes the cardinality of the given set $X$. $P_{C_{i,j}}$ is the set of affected phases by the proposal $C_{i,j}$. Similarly, $R_{C_{i,j}}$ is that of affected roles of stakeholders in the same context.

% Thus, the global influence score of a given proposal that denotes as $g_{C_{i},j}$ can be calculated as follows:
% \begin{equation}
% g_{C_{i},j} =
% \frac
% % 分子 k local=(P R)
% {f_{C_{i,j}} |P_{C_{i,j}}| |R_{C_{i,j}}|} 
% % ----分式线-----
% % 分母 f平均
% {\frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{m=1}^n{f_{C_{i,m}}}\right)}
% % 满足条件
% ,\ 
% C_{i,j} \in C_{i},\ C_{i} \in \mathbb{C}
% \label{final}
% \end{equation}

% A higher score of $g_{C_{i},j}$ indicates that the proposal has a wider and deeper influence on project success. We post-process the result of a score by descending ranking, in which we select the ones higher than average value. This subset of proposals are tagged by sub-topics and enrolled in the solution checklist.

% \subsection{Making of Evaluation Tool}
% \label{section:tool}

% First, there is a comparison and contrast of the solutions of both phases to evaluate the agreement between the phases.

% If there is some degree of agreement that can contribute to the evaluation tool, a 2-level hierarchical structure mark sheet will be created using the following method.

% The 2-level hierarchical mark sheet consists of an outer level of the primary themes we used in our entire research; and the inner level of the sub-themes of when the solution is recommended with a new round of qualitative analysis. The solutions are all populated under the sub-themes with normalized weights calculated as follows.
% \begin{equation}
% w_i = \frac{100s_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n{s_i}}\%, s_i \in \mathbb{S}
% \label{formula:toolweight}
% \end{equation}

% In formula \ref{formula:toolweight}, $\mathbb{S}$ denotes the collection of solutions of both phases. $s_i$ is a solution in same collection. $w_i$ is the weight of a given solution $s_i$. $g_i$ is the global influence score of the same given solution.


% When a user mark a project with the mark sheet, the user rate out of 10, on how well the project has done given a solution. The scores are calculated as follows.
% \begin{equation}
% s_i = \frac{r_i}{10w_i\%}, S = \sum_{i=1}^n{s_i}
% \label{formula:toolscore}
% \end{equation}
% In formula \ref{formula:toolscore}, $S$ denotes the final score. $s_i$ is the score of a given solution, $w_i$ is the weight of the same solution, $r_i$ is the user rating out of 10.

% A higher final score of $S$ indicates the higher possibility of success.
