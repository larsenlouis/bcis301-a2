\section{Solution Analysis}

In this section, some potential solutions are first put forward to tackle the identified issues in the previous section. Considered the generic IT deployment strategy of the organization, the solutions are topic based and then evaluated as defined in methodology. The outcome of this section is the production of the selected solutions to be put in the hierarchy of planning.

\subsection{Potential Solutions}

According the methodology, the following possible solutions are drafted to solve the topics of issues that have discussed in the previous section. Also, the computing department is considered to fit in centrally planned IT deployment strategy. There are 5 topics of issues identified in data analysis. For each topic, there will be one or more solutions to be evaluated the later part of this section.

\subsubsection{Linux with Docker}
Linux with docker is a solution for issues related to budget, security and software.

Linux is a free and opensource operating system started in 1991, which is a free version of UNIX system back in 1970s. Linux is able to be running on multiple architectures with various configurations of hardwares.

Docker is a container platform that is able to separate the environment of execution from the physical operating system running on the physical machine. Docker relies to an hypervisor software such as VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation and so on. For less budget to be spent, the free and opensource Virtualbox is selected to run the docker on Linux platform.

The Combination of Linux and Docker is due to the following factors. Firstly, docker is more performant in Linux physical machine via VirtualBox hypervising abstructing the hardwares. Secondly, the current IT deployment involved with a centralized administration on Windows platform fails to deliver the freedom  and the accessibility of installing and running students' softwares, especially the networking students who study configuration of operating systems with tedious and repeated setups of virtual machines. Finally, according to the TechLab tutor, Linux is considered to be the operating system for their labs, which favors the need of both tutors and students.

\subsubsection{Telegram}

Telegram is end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application running on multiple platforms such as Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

Telegram provides the messaging functionalities that other IM applications fail to achieve. In telegram, all the messages are tagged with reading status of unread and read. This feature fits the enterprise working environment, targeted for more effective communications. Moreover, telegram is able to send any kinds of file that is less than 1.5 GB, which brings the idea of 'agile' to the small and flexible working environment in Department of Computing. The two highlighted features enable the department to solve the communication issues and security concerns partially.

\subsubsection{Slack}
Slack is another solution to the communication issues. Slack is enterprise oriented instant messaging application that features projects, channels and other high customizable functions.

The highlighted feature is channel. Channel acts like a group chat on a specific topic. Slack enables permission administration on channels so that users of different readability are organized to carry out scheduled tasks accordingly. Another practical feature is the chatting history. A new joined user is able to view the messages and files submitted to the channel before he or she joins.

\subsubsection{Jira}

Jira is a comprehensive tool for issue and tracking. Jira can reduce the manual process involved in the department and lower communication barriers. There are so many manual process in the workflows of several functions inside the department. Jira administrator is able to define a customized the workflows in a contexts connects several roles. Process is defined in a workflow chart that stakeholders are fully aware of the progress they are making. Permission management is well covered by scopes of project, group, user and workflow. In other words, a task goes through the workflow that can decides who does something at what time and that who has the permission to view or alter state or history. Moreover, Jira integrates a reporting system in the software that helps to do statistics for future adjustment in the department.

With careful investigation and design of workflows in the department, Jira is able to digitalizes the communication process in various kinds of tasks and facilities high efficiency of communication.

\subsubsection{Windows 10 Sandbox}
Computing department is experiencing the restriction of using softwares in labs. One of the reason causing this is whole dependency of the centrally governed administration policy with Active Directory. Nevertheless, this technology lowers the cost of management of rooms of machines. The number of installed programs stops students wish to run the helpful tools they want. The new Windows 10 sandbox is a feature that runs a virtual machine on a Windows 10 operating system without an extra license. A policy can be implemented to limit the disk usage of students and to grant them the permission to run all kinds of softwares they wish.

Only a tiny effort of configuration to enable this feature and to set up some restriction can make a total difference of the deployment of softwares in computer labs.

\subsubsection{New Network and Servers}
The setup of existing two separated networks ensures the security but accessibility is impacted. On the network, there are obsoleting services running that need changing for the centralized services of the local area network. Furthermore, the TechLabs tutor demands for new servers to scale up. We argue that there should be a new design of architecture that solve the security and accessibility problem at the same.

Site-to-site VPN is a method for connecting two isolated networks with controllable configuration of firewall. New servers should be purchased to scale up the the labs and the servers that powers the local SMB shared folders with redundancy.

\subsection{Evaluation of Solutions}
An evaluation of the aforementioned candidate solutions is done according to the framework mentioned in Methodology.

\subsubsection{Rating of Candidate Solutions}

Scores are given to the topics of issues in the section of Data Analysis, namely budget, communication, manual process, security and software. The result is shown in \autoref{tab:eva}.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Result of Evaluation}
The average score of all the candidate solutions $\bar{R_{S}}$ is 17.833. According to the aforementioned evaluation framework in Methodology, The following solutions are eligible to become the final solutions for this IT deployment plan of computing department of Ara Institute of Canterbury. They are Jira, Telegram, Linux deployment with docker and Windows 10 Sandbox. With a further inspection on the selected solution, we find that all the 4 solutions cover all the topics of issues.


% \subsection{Overview of Data}
% In Phase 2, 10 case studies are given on how projects failed in Victoria Australia. The cases are government-related information communication and technology projects. The author\parencite{case_study} provides well-structured anatomy of projects where issues are discussed in depth by topics. Additionally, some recommendations are given by the author, some of which is responded by the project owners.

% After the qualitative analysis, the same primary themes are used bacause we have found they can be appiled in this research context without much loss of information and it will possibly reduce the complexity of the evaluation tool we are trying to build. 

% \subsection{Gaps and Solutions}
% Using the same method, we collect gaps and possible solutions(proposals) for further evaluation. There are 54 gaps reflecting 54 proposals to 10 case studies, some of which are duplicate in meaning. The author uses no mathematical model to prioritize gaps, a baseline value of $1$ is also used to all the proposals, according to the predefined methodology.

% The collected data are tagged with the same four themes: control, process, people and structure. Here are some samples under each theme.

% \subsubsection{Samples: Control}
% % id 21
% In case 4, the author argues that the longer planning that spans in time, the more risk of redesigned. Ultimately, the project will be likely to fail due to this uncertainty of change. Project leaders should plan to fund well with top management support in the initial phase. As change happens at any time, if the project cycle is too long, the project will be more likely to require more funding. Correspondingly, the uncertainty of the project increases with time, and the initial design and costing plan are very likely to need to change over time, so the risk of project failure increases.


% % id 2
% In case 1, it is the rushing to meet deadlines that fails to deliver design goals. For cover-up, benefits are altered to please the government. Project managers should define the measurement of deliverables and change accordingly. A good case plan is the foundation of a project's success. If the case plan is just made to win the government support without respecting the facts, the result of project failure is foreseeable. In this case, many of benefits are unmeasurable but they are still written into the plan to please the government. Its failure is unavoidable.

% \subsubsection{Samples: Process}
% % id 26
% Poor user training and post-implementation support result in bad experience among users. Better user training and support should be designed and implemented in the early stage of project planning. In case 5, even the project (CRIS) has been delivered to the end-users in July 2008, because of the lack of necessary training and the poor system support services, the feature change request from the user cannot get a proper response in time, which results in pretty low user satisfaction of the system.

% % 30
% The training cost is not included in the planning process. It is suggested to consider training in cost planning. In case 6, due to lack of adequate up-front planning, the project plan didn't include the expense for Ultranet coaches and the cost for school professional development day. Thus it caused a funding problem around \$23 million. A comprehensive plan is the cornerstone of the project's success, to avoid a funding gap, IT projects should be handled with care when reviewing funding plans.

% \subsubsection{Samples: People}
% % 34
% Failing to detect risks of vendor results in bad contract deals. Vendor performance should be reviewed by a third party in planning. In case 7, even DOJ has made various efforts to address vendor performance issues, the vendor is still frequently failing to meet the promised timeline. In September 2008, the owner of the vendor changed, and DOJ had to renegotiate the contract with the new owner of the vendor. Due to fearing that the new owner would abandon the contract, DOJ had to make concessions on the liability for delay and the indemnity clause. This fully demonstrates the importance of an objective assessment of the supplier's performance capabilities. It is recommended that the tenderer should hire an independent, qualified third-party agency to evaluate the vendor's capabilities and historical performance.


% % 37
% Projects fail and lead to an alternative solution when requirements are not communicated precisely. It is important to understand the requirements and define the deliverables that the project manager and the end-user agree on.

% According to the Supreme Court of Australia, ICMS’s case management system (CourtView) fails to meet the court’s needs. The Supreme Court has ultimately resolved to pilot its own system to provide case management. ICMS is a typical case which is developed by the client and vendor. The end user did not get an opportunity to participate in their opinion before the system is shipped to them. Systems developed in this way are very likely to cause dissatisfaction to end users. After all, most of the time, the people who pay (the customers or clients) are not the people who use the system. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court finally chose to fund the development of the system it needed, spending only a small amount of money and getting a good satisfaction.

% \subsubsection{Samples: Structure}
% % 4
% The vacancy of a project leader results in management chaos. It is important to have a project leader. Unfortunately, they appointed two project manager in case 1, one is a business project manager, the other is a technical project manager. Since none of them is authoritative, neither person is responsible for the overall result of the project. To make matters worse, after-the-fact investigations have shown that both project managers are lack experience in managing large IT projects. A qualified, authoritative is irreplaceable for such projects.

% % 19
% The organization structure stops from making timely funding to implement the project. A better organization is advised. There are uncertainties in any IT project, and good organizational and funding plans can help overcome these uncertainties. The VicRoads project did not receive follow-up development funds, as a result, the development team has basically been disbanded, and the project prospects are not good. VicRoads has already spent \$52 million in past years, it will be a huge waste to Australia government. 


% \subsection{Evaluation of Solutions}
% To select the solutions out of all the proposals, we do the same evaluation steps as shown in \ref{section:evaluation}.

% With the defined method, we tag all our research contexts as $C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots, C_{10}$. We assume all the solutions from the 10 case studies are of equal importance, given the fact that there is no math model used in Phase 2. Therefore, we pad the cross-contextual coefficient with a baseline value of 1 to all the $\mathit{k_{C_{i},j}}$ in formula \ref{brief}. So formula \ref{final} can be simplified as 

% \begin{equation}
% g_{C_{i},j} = l_{C_{i},j} = |P_{C_{i,j}}| |R_{C_{i,j}}|
% \label{formula:p2}
% \end{equation}

% With the updated formula \ref{formula:p2}, we calculate the global influence score for each proposal. Here is a visualization of the scores of all the proposals in Phase 2.

% In Figure \ref{fig:rankingp2}, there are 3 groups: the leading group of 3 proposals, the group of majority and the trailing group.
